    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2N0dzNb" target="blank">Clean Architecture</a> - by applying universal rules of
      software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software
      system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary
      software craftsman Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reveals those rules and helps you apply them.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2JIjOrz" target="blank">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a> - even
      bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year,
      countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that
      way.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2L6mcE0" target="blank">Code Complete</a> - widely considered one of the best practical
      guides to programming, Steve McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has been helping developers write better software
      for more than a decade. </li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2MlI3wW" target="blank">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> - learn how to uncover the
      hints and hidden details in a question, discover how to break down a problem into manageable chunks, develop
      techniques to unstick yourself when stuck, learn (or re-learn) core computer science concepts, and practice on 189
      interview questions and solutions.</li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NPhvRX" target="blank">The Clean Coder</a> - this book is packed with practical
      advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique:
      It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work
      well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and
      understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.</li>
    <li><a href='http://amzn.to/2BNciX2' target="blank">The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide</a> - early in
      his software developer career, John Sonmez discovered that technical knowledge alone isn't enough to break through
      to the next income level - developers need "soft skills" like the ability to learn new technologies just in time,
      communicate clearly with management and consulting clients, negotiate a fair hourly rate, and unite teammates and
      coworkers in working toward a common goal.</li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/39O7hMm" target="blank">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote
      the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the
      joy of coding. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for
      keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/37JCaQj" target="blank">The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</a> - Few
      books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend
      of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing
      complex projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2s7BKEk" target="blank">Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual</a> - Soft
      Skills: The software developer's life manual is a unique guide, offering techniques and practices for a more
      satisfying life as a professional software developer. In it, developer and life coach John Sonmez addresses a wide
      range of important "soft" topics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/35DDaUU" target="blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> - Introduces HTML and
      CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone―hobbyists, students, and professionals―and it’s full-color
      throughout.
      Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2FvYl0e" target="blank">Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide</a> - At any
      given moment, someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. And, chances are, someone else
      has already solved your problem. This edition of Head First Design Patterns shows you the tried-and-true,
      road-tested patterns used by developers to create functional, elegant, reusable, and flexible software.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2T4zrNk" target="blank">Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and
        other curious people</a> - Grokking Algorithms is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to
      apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer. You'll start with sorting
      and searching and, as you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns
      such as data compression and artificial intelligence.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37KZsFq" target="blank">A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript. The new tech-assisted
        approach that requires half the effort</a> - Learning JavaScript is hell because of two problems.
      I remove the problems, and you start having fun.
      The first problem is retention. You remember only ten or twenty percent of what you read. That spells failure. To
      become fluent in a computer language, you have to retain pretty much everything.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2N3fnqX" target="blank">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> -
      What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers? In CODE, they show
      us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through
      CODE, we see how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological
      innovations of the past two centuries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZYNDsJ" target="blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a> -
      JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to
      browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with,
      JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2TWfwPg" target="blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> - Structure
      and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past
      decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of
      the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have
      incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition
      was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to
      dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and
      lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming.
